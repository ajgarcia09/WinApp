Win is an activity tracking application that allows the user to log activities such as running, 
swimming and sleeping, and to set fitness goals, such as target sleep and active time, as
well as number of steps to take per day.

To test it out, in the src folder, under "winPrototype" run HomeScreen.java.
The program will start at the homescreen, which will display a welcome message
for the user, the number of steps taken so far (which was randomly generated)
and a menu buton and a "log activity" button.

All images used in this application are located in the source path. However, please
note that the images may not display and/or may not display correctly. This may 
affect the ability to run the program in different environments.
